## Programming Assignment 1
Implementation of deep neural networks from scratch for multiclass classification with mean squared error and cross entropy loss, tanh, relu and sigmoid activations, gradient descent, momentum, nag and adam optimizers with l2 regularization.  

### Prerequisites 
1) Numpy  
2) Pickle 
3) Sklearn

### Usage
Download the directory and use bash run.sh in terminal. Change placeholders in run.sh for train, validation and test data. Weights will be stored in save_dir and logs will be stored in expt_dir along with predictions.
